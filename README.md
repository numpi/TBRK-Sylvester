# TBRK-Sylvester
Tensor block rational Krylov methods for solving multiterm Sylvester equations

The algorithms contained in this repository are described in 
Casulli, A., Tensorized block rational Krylov methods for multiterm Sylvester equations.

To run codes in MATLAB the packages RKTooblox and TT-Toolbox are needed.
